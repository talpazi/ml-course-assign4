## Repository Description

This repository contains the solution for **Assignment 3**, which extends the original Chapter 11 implementation from *Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn* (Raschka et al., 2022) by adding a second hidden layer and evaluating the model on the MNIST dataset.

The project includes three implementations:
1. Original single-hidden-layer ANN (baseline from the book)
2. Revised two-hidden-layer ANN implemented from scratch using NumPy (with softmax output)
3. Equivalent two-hidden-layer ANN implemented using Keras (TensorFlow)
